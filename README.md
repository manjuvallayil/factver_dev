# CARAG: Context-Aware Retrieval and Explanation Generation Framework
-Welcome to the official repository for CARAG, an end-to-end explainable framework for Automated Fact Verification (AFV) systems. This repository includes the source code and dataset used in our research, which introduces CARAG as a novel methodology integrating thematic embeddings and Subset of Interest (SOI) for contextually aligned and transparent fact verification.

## Overview
**CARAG enhances AFV systems by:
	•	Leveraging thematic embeddings derived from a focused SOI to incorporate local and global perspectives.
	•	Integrating evidence retrieval and explanation generation, ensuring alignment with topic-based thematic contexts.
	•	Providing transparency and explainability through SOI graphs and thematic embeddings.

** Key highlights:
	•	FactVer Dataset: A novel, explanation-focused dataset specifically curated to enhance thematic alignment and transparency in AFV.
	•	Evaluation: CARAG outperforms standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods in thematic alignment and explainability.

** Features
	•	Context-Aware Evidence Retrieval: Combines thematic embeddings with claim-specific vectors.
	•	Explanation Generation Pipeline: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) in a zero-shot paradigm.
	•	Visualization: Supports thematic SOI graphs for enhanced transparency.

## Dataset
-The FactVer dataset, published on Hugging Face @ https://huggingface.co/datasets/manjuvallayil/factver_master provides structured evidence relationships and human-generated explanations across multiple topics. It is a key component of CARAG’s evaluation.
-The dataset is also available as a csv file in this repo, factver_master.csv 

## Getting Started
** Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8 or higher
	•	Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and transformers.

** Installation
-Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/manjuvallayil/factver_dev.git
cd factver_dev
-Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

** 🛠️ Running the Framework
	1.	Initialize Parameters- Modify parameters in carag_eval.ipynb as needed:
	•	Dataset: FactVer (manjuvallayil/factver_master)
	•	Embedding Model: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
	•	LLaMA Model: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
	•	Other parameters: Similarity threshold (delta), weight parameter (alpha), and n_docs(no of evidence pieces) to retrieve.
	2.	Run Evaluation Notebook- Open and run carag_eval.ipynb to execute the CARAG pipeline, including:
	•	Loading the dataset and models.
	•	Generating thematic embeddings and SOI.
	•	Evidence retrieval and explanation generation.
	•	Visualizing the SOI graph.
	3.	Output:
The notebook generates quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics and visualizations showcasing CARAG’s thematic alignment and explainability.

## Repository Structure
