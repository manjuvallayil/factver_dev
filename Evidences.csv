Evidence_Covid_B2.0_509,covid vaccine_4142,we are urging all healthcare staff to do the same again this year by getting vaccinated against both COVID-19 and flu.
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_510,covid vaccine_4142,"There are different variants of the flu virus that often change annually, which is why you should get the vaccine each year if you can. Immunity from COVID-19 (either from the vaccine or having had the virus) wanes over time so, for the best protection for yourself, your colleagues and your patients you will need another dose."
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_511,covid vaccine_4144,"Federal funding for COVID-19 vaccines is running out. The government has footed the bill since the vaccines became available in late 2020. Once it steps away, COVID vaccination will be privatized. Doctors will have to pay for the vaccine doses upfront and hope that they make their money back."
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_512,covid vaccine_4144,"Since the federal government has been paying for the vaccine, Chung doesn’t lose any money from waste. But that will change when she has to start paying for the COVID vaccine upfront. "
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_513,covid vaccine_4144,"A Pfizer spokesperson did, saying in an email that the company expects to have single-dose vials of COVID vaccine available early next year. Chung said that would help cut down on waste, but she would still have to pay for the vials upfront."

Evidence_Covid_B2.0_542,covid vaccine_4164,"The new film, released Nov. 21, revives several debunked claims and repackages them to allege that COVID-19 vaccines are part of a depopulation scheme by global elites who want to establish a global regime."
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_543,covid vaccine_4164,"A woman featured in the film who said she’d been embalming bodies for more than a decade described long, allegedly abnormal clots and concluded, ""I have never seen anything like this until the vaccination."" An anonymous narrator said, ""We know something different is going on. We don’t know exactly what's going on. But the timing of it is just hand in hand — we’re connecting dots here. And it certainly appears that there’s some relationship to the vaccines and these obstructions that we’re seeing."" "
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_544,covid vaccine_4164,"The ""evidence"" in the film quickly falls apart under scrutiny, she said. For example, the movie showed video clips of people who collapsed or died unexpectedly and implied those people died because of COVID-19 vaccines."
Evidence_Covid_B2.0_545,covid vaccine_4164,"McCarthy said the film also relies heavily on statements from one embalmer to promote its core claim that the vaccines are causing abnormal blood clots. That embalmer, Richard Hirschman, has promoted his baseless claims about clots and COVID-19 vaccines"

Evidence_Electric_Vehicles_C2.1_439,Electric vehicles_8871,"Vikram Kirloskar, the vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said on Friday that the automaker will bring electric vehicles into India in future, but at the moment it is focusing on hybrid vehicles keeping in mind the objective of meeting holistic carbon reduction."
Evidence_Electric_Vehicles_C2.1_440,Electric vehicles_8871,"Speaking to news agency PTI, Kirloskar said I think the country's objective is to reduce carbon (emission)."
Evidence_Electric_Vehicles_C2.1_441,Electric vehicles_8871,You have to look at it holistically and (on a) scientific basis and that's what we are doing.
Evidence_Electric_Vehicles_C2.1_442,Electric vehicles_8871,This was in response to Toyota's strategy of focussing on hybrid vehicles at a time when electric vehicles have started gaining traction in the country.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_175,covid vaccine_4079,Researchers from the Centenary Institute and the University of Sydney have developed a new nasal vaccination strategy that induces potent lung immunity and protection against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_176,covid vaccine_4079,The new vaccine approach has been tested successfully in mice and has the potential to be a powerful tool for enhancing protection against COVID-19 infection and minimizing ongoing viral spread.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_177,covid vaccine_4079,"Our vaccine differs from most current COVID-19 vaccines in that it enables generation of an immune response directly in those areas of the body that are likely to be the first point of contact for the virus¡ªthe nose, airway and lungs. This may help explain the vaccine's effectiveness, said Dr. Ashhurst."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_178,covid vaccine_4079,"Our vaccination findings have shown exciting potential in pre-clinical studies, improving protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The approach developed here could help break the COVID-19 infection cycle and will likely influence future coronavirus vaccine related studies, Professor Britton said."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_179,covid vaccine_4079,"He added that adapted versions of the new nasal vaccine could also be potentially applied to other viral or bacterial respiratory diseases such as influenza, avian flu, SARS and MERS."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_180,covid vaccine_4079,"Current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 substantially reduce mortality and severe disease, but protection against infection is less effective."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_181,covid vaccine_4080,"The NIH website, ClinicalTrials.gov shows that in the U.S. alone there are 150 Vaccine Studies and an even higher number of Drug Studies at 661. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_182,covid vaccine_4080,"For instance, in June 2022, Pfizer Inc. announced to strengthen its commitment to US manufacturing with a US$ 120 million investment at its Kalamazoo, Michigan, facility, enabling US-based production in support of its COVID-19 oral treatment. "

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_428,covid_4332,"As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post¨CCOVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death (1)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_429,covid_4332,"These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity (2)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_430,covid_4332,"Exposure risk can be mitigated through nonpharmaceutical interventions, including improving ventilation, use of masks or respirators indoors, and testing (4). The risk for medically significant illness increases with age, disability status, and underlying medical conditions but is considerably reduced by immunity derived from vaccination, previous infection, or both, as well as timely access to effective biomedical prevention measures and treatments (3,5)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_431,covid_4332,COVID-19 vaccines are highly protective against severe illness and death and provide a lesser degree of protection against asymptomatic and mild infection (6).
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_432,covid_4332,"COVID-19 remains an ongoing public health threat; however, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of medical and nonpharmaceutical interventions have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_433,covid_4333,"Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 18 years of age and older. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_434,covid_4333,"¡°Authorizing an additional COVID-19 vaccine expands the available vaccine options for the prevention of COVID-19, including the most severe outcomes that can occur such as hospitalization and death,¡± said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_435,covid_4333,"Today¡¯s authorization offers adults in the United States who have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine another option that meets the FDA¡¯s rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_436,covid_4333,"COVID-19 vaccines remain the best preventive measure against severe disease caused by COVID-19 and I encourage anyone who is eligible for, but has not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine, to consider doing so."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_437,covid_4333,"The FDA has determined that the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_438,covid_4333,"In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that a thorough analysis and evaluation of the available safety and effectiveness data and manufacturing information have been conducted."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_439,covid_4336,"The United States seems to have hit a Covid-19 plateau, with more than 40,000 people hospitalized and more than 400 deaths a day consistently over the past month or so."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_440,covid_4336,"And there are big question marks around what might happen next, as the coronavirus¡¯ evolution remains quite elusive 2? years into the pandemic."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_441,covid_4336,"¡°We¡¯ve never really cracked that: why these surges go up and down, how long it stays up and how fast it comes down,¡± said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research. ¡°All these things are still somewhat of a mystery.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_442,covid_4336,But the plateau in hospitalizations is ¡°encouraging¡± because it means the subvariant probably has worked its way through most of the hosts it can find.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_443,covid_4336,"¡°Right now, the question is what comes as we descend from BA.5. It could take weeks.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_444,covid_4336,"CDC ensemble forecasts predict stable trends in hospitalizations and deaths over the coming weeks, and experts agree that the worst of the wave has probably passed."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_445,covid_4337,"In April, President Joe Biden issued a Memorandum on Addressing the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19, which called for the creation of two reports."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_446,covid_4337,"Within 120 days, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), leading a whole-of-government response, developed two reports that together, pave an actionable path forward to address Long COVID and associated conditions."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_447,covid_4337,The National Research Action Plan on Long COVID details advances in current research and charts a course for future study to better understand prevention and treatment of Long COVID.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_451,covid_4338,"There are signs that the United Kingdom could be heading into a fall Covid-19 wave, and experts say the United States may not be far behind."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_452,covid_4338,"¡°Generally, what happens in the UK is reflected about a month later in the US. I think this is what I¡¯ve sort of been seeing,¡± said Dr. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College London."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_453,covid_4338,"Spector runs the Zoe Health Study, which uses an app to let people in the UK and US report their daily symptoms."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_454,covid_4338,"Spector says the study, which has been running since the days of the first lockdown in England in 2020, has accurately captured the start of each wave, and its numbers run about one to two weeks ahead of official government statistics."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_455,covid_4338,"After seeing a downward trend for the past few weeks, the Zoe study saw a 30% increase in reported Covid-19 cases within the past week."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_456,covid_4338,"On Friday, that increase was reflected in official UK government data too, although it was not as large as the increases reported by Zoe loggers."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_457,covid_4339,"Following today¡¯s meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices¡¯ (ACIP), CDC is expanding eligibility of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to everyone 5 years of age and older."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_458,covid_4339,CDC now recommends that children ages 5 through 11 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their initial Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination series.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_459,covid_4339,"As cases increase across the country, a booster dose will safely help restore and enhance protection against severe disease."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_460,covid_4339,"In addition, today CDC is strengthening its recommendation that those 12 and older who are immunocompromised and those 50 and older should receive a second booster dose at least 4 months after their first. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_461,covid_4339,"Whether it is your first booster, or your second, if you haven¡¯t had a vaccine dose since the beginning of December 2021 and you are eligible, now is the time to get one."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_462,covid_4339,"With cases increasing, it is important that all people have the protection they need, which is why, today, CDC has also strengthened another booster recommendation. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_463,covid_4340,"Today, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., endorsed the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices¡¯ (ACIP) recommendation that all children 6 months through 5 years of age should receive a COVID-19 vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_464,covid_4340,This expands eligibility for vaccination to nearly 20 million additional children and means that all Americans ages 6 months and older are now eligible for vaccination. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_465,covid_4340,Parents and caregivers can now get their children 6 months through 5 years of age vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to better protect them from COVID-19.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_466,covid_4340,"All children, including children who have already had COVID-19, should get vaccinated."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_467,covid_4340, Children in this younger age group can be vaccinated with whichever vaccine is available (either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech).
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_468,covid_4340,"I encourage parents and caregivers with questions to talk to their doctor, nurse, or local pharmacist to learn more about the benefits of vaccinations and the importance of protecting their children by getting them vaccinated."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_469,covid_4342,"Compared with patients aged 0¨C17 years without previous COVID-19, those with previous COVID-19 had higher rates of acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_470,covid_4342,"The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevated adjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with those without). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_471,covid_4342,"Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in this study population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs and symptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurological conditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleeping disorders."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_472,covid_4342,"Among children aged 2¨C4 years, the highest aHRs for patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 were for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (aHR  = 2.39), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.52), and coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (1.47) (Table 3). Unlike other age groups, children aged 2¨C4 years had higher rates of asthma diagnosis (1.12) and respiratory signs and symptoms (1.07) after COVID-19."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_473,covid_4342,"Among children aged 5¨C11 years, the highest aHRs for patients with COVID-19 compared with those without were for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (2.84), venous thromboembolic event (2.69), and acute and unspecified renal failure (1.38)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_474,covid_4342,"Among patients aged 12¨C17 years, the highest aHRs for those with COVID-19 compared with those without were for acute pulmonary embolism (2.03), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.66), and venous thromboembolic event (1.52)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_475,covid_4343,"The world has never been in a better position to end the Covid-19 pandemic, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_476,covid_4343,"¡°Last week, the number of weekly reported deaths from Covid-19 was the lowest since March 2020,¡± he said. ¡°We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic. We¡¯re not there yet, but the end is in sight."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_477,covid_4343,"There is still a risk of more variants, deaths, disruption and uncertainty, he said, ¡°so let¡¯s seize this opportunity.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_478,covid_4343,"They are ¡°an urgent call for governments to take a hard look at their policies and strengthen them for Covid-19 and future pathogens with pandemic potential,¡± Tedros said."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_479,covid_4343,"Although official case counts have become significantly underreported, trends have shown a steady drop in cases both globally and in the US."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_481,covid_4345,"Today, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., signed a decision memo that Novavax¡¯s COVID-19 vaccine be used as another primary series option for adolescents ages 12 through 17."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_482,covid_4345,This recommendation follows FDA¡¯s authorization to authorize the vaccine for this age group under emergency use. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_483,covid_4345,"Novavax¡¯s COVID-19 vaccine, which is available now, is an important tool in the pandemic and provides a more familiar type of COVID-19 vaccine technology for adolescents. Having multiple types of vaccines offers more options and flexibility for the public, jurisdictions, and vaccine providers."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_484,covid_4345,Novavax¡¯s COVID-19 vaccine packages harmless proteins of the COVID-19 virus alongside another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to the virus in the future. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_485,covid_4345,"Vaccines¡ªlike the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine¡ªthat use protein subunit technology have been used for more than 30 years in the United States, beginning with the first licensed hepatitis B vaccine."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_496,covid_4347,"¡°It looks like we¡¯re going in the right direction,¡± he said, adding: ¡°However, I think it would be a bit cavalier to all of a sudden say, ¡®We¡¯re completely through with [the pandemic].¡¯¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_497,covid_4347,"Fauci pointed to the summer of 2021, when the U.S. saw similarly low pandemic trends, only for the omicron variant to emerge and cause a record-breaking surge in cases last winter."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_498,covid_4347,"Emerging research suggests that some new subvariants, including one called BA.4.6, appear to evade immunity even more effectively than BA.5 ¡ª though it¡¯s unclear whether any of them will overtake BA.5 as the country¡¯s dominant Covid strain."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_511,covid_4352,"China has become the first country to green-light an inhaled Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for potential use of the needle-free product in the country, where suppressing the spread of Covid-19 remains a top priority."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_512,covid_4352,"The vaccine maker, CanSino Biologics, said in a statement Sunday that China¡¯s medicines regulator had approved the inhaled dose for emergency use as a booster vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_513,covid_4352,"The product, known as Convidecia Air, delivers a vaccine dose through a puff of air from a nebulizer that is then inhaled by mouth. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_514,covid_4352,"According to a database maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), CanSino¡¯s new product is one of two specifically ¡°inhaled¡± vaccines that had reached clinical phase development, as a number of companies worldwide research innovative ways to deliver Covid-19 protection via the nose and mouth."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_553,covid_4364,"There have been one million COVID-19 deaths so far this year ¨C a ¡°tragic milestone¡± that must lead to more people being vaccinated against the disease, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported on Thursday. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_554,covid_4364,"¡°We cannot say we are learning to live with COVID-19 when one million people have died with COVID-19 this year alone, when we are two-and-a-half years into the pandemic and have all the tools necessary to prevent these deaths,¡± said Tedros, speaking during his regular briefing from Geneva.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_555,covid_4364,"He again urged all governments to step up action to vaccinate all health workers, older persons, and others at highest risk, as part of efforts towards inoculating 70 per cent of the global population. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_556,covid_4364,"Although welcoming progress on coverage of high-priority groups, Tedros stressed that more must be done as one-third of the world¡¯s population remains unvaccinated.  "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_557,covid_4364,"Today, only 10 countries still have less than 10 per cent coverage, most of which are facing humanitarian emergencies.? "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_558,covid_4364,"In January, WHO and partners launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership, focused mainly on the 34 countries that were at or below 10 per cent coverage.  All but six are on the continent. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_559,covid_4365,"People who had COVID-19 are at higher risk for a host of brain injuries a year later compared with people who were never infected by the coronavirus, a finding that could affect millions of Americans, U.S. researchers reported on Thursday."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_560,covid_4365,"The year-long study, published in Nature Medicine, assessed brain health across 44 different disorders using medical records without patient identifiers from millions of U.S. veterans."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_561,covid_4365,Brain and other neurological disorders occurred in 7% more of those who had been infected with COVID compared with a similar group of veterans who had never been infected. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_562,covid_4365,"That translates into roughly 6.6 million Americans who had brain impairments linked with their COVID infections, the team said."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_563,covid_4365,"The results show the devastating long-term effects of COVID-19, senior author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly of Washington University School of Medicine said in a statement."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_564,covid_4365,"Memory impairments, commonly referred to as brain fog, were the most common symptom. Compared with the control groups, people infected with COVID had a 77% higher risk of developing memory problems."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_589,covid_4374,The anti-vaccine movement is gaining strength even after 1 million Americans have died of Covid-19.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_590,covid_4374,"Worse, experts fear the politicized backlash to the Covid-19 vaccines is already fostering skepticism about routine vaccinations generally, from childhood immunizations to flu shots."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_591,covid_4374,"Across the country, Republican lawmakers have drafted a pile of anti-vaccine mandate bills this year, chipping away at a foundational health practice for the last half-century."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_592,covid_4374,"Although that might be an effect of missed checkups during the worst of the pandemic, there are other signs that faith in vaccines might be falling: Fewer Americans said this year and last year that they will get the flu shot compared to the few years before, according to a new poll from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_593,covid_4374,"And with the anti-vaccine movement growing stronger, experts expect its adherents to grow only more ambitious, targeting the school vaccine mandates that have been critical up to now in eradicating diseases like measles, mumps, and polio."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_594,covid_4374,Yet the US seems to be coming out of the pandemic not only lagging in seasonal Covid-19 and flu shots but also with many politicians eager to roll back the measures that had once made routine vaccinations the rare issue to have more than 90 percent approval from the American public.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_607,covid_4270,The COVID-19 crisis triggered a mortality shock resulting in LE declines in 2020 of a magnitude not observed in the recent history of high-income countries
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_608,covid_4270,"While data limitations have precluded in-depth analyses in low-to-middle-income countries, emerging evidence suggests even larger losses than those observed in high-income countries (such as in India?and Latin America)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_609,covid_4270,"Emerging estimates of LE losses based on excess deaths suggest that most western European countries are expected to partly recover from the losses observed in 2020, while other countries (including the United States and Russia) will suffer further LE declines."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_610,covid_4270,"In all countries, LE in 2021 was lower than expected under the continuation of pre-pandemic trends."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_611,covid_4270,"For example, while US mortality for ages 80+ returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, overall LE losses grew due to worsening mortality in ages below 60. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_612,covid_4270,The COVID-19 pandemic led to global increases in mortality and declines in period LE that are without precedent over the past 70 years.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_631,covid_4274,"Paxlovid, the antiviral pill that reduces the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid-19, also reduces the risk of long Covid, according to a new study by researchers at the US Department of Veterans Affairs."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_632,covid_4274,"The study, posted online as a preprint on Saturday, analyzed electronic records for more than 56,000 veterans with Covid-19, including more than 9,000 who were treated with Paxlovid within the first five days of their infection."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_633,covid_4274,That corresponded to 2.3 fewer cases of long Covid conditions per 100 people three months after their diagnosis.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_634,covid_4274,Paxlovid also reduced the risk of hospitalization or death following acute Covid-19.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_635,covid_4274," Paxlovid reduced the risk of long Covid in people who were unvaccinated, vaccinated and boosted, and in people experiencing their first Covid-19 infection or a reinfection, the study said."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_642,covid_4275,"Scientists do not understand the underlying cause of long Covid yet, though there¡¯s a growing consensus that it is likely several distinct conditions and not a single disease. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_643,covid_4276,"With the exception of loss of taste or smell, many of the symptoms of flu will overlap with all of these other illnesses."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_644,covid_4276,"RSV is not something that typically comes with high fevers, but can cause fevers in children."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_645,covid_4276,There¡¯s really no way to differentiate between RSV and other cold viruses without a test.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_646,covid_4276,"There¡¯s no home testing options for the flu or most other cold viruses, but most hospitals and clinics have access to both rapid tests and more sensitive tests, which test for several different viruses and take a little longer to return results."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_647,covid_4276,"COVID tests remain fairly accessible to most Washingtonians, who can either pick one up at a pharmacy or drug store or order free kits from the state¡¯s home testing program."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_648,covid_4276,"Many of those symptoms overlap, unfortunately, so it can be really difficult for people to tell what¡¯s what without testing."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_649,covid_4277,"Yeah, Victoria is saying 25% increase in cases, about a 20% increase in hospitalisations. And if you look at the national average, which has got some flaws in it because of the way states are reporting, about an 11% increase in cases and a 30% increase in deaths, albeit off a very low base. So the tom-toms are a-beating that this surge is on."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_650,covid_4277,"And then the other thing that Victoria has been able to reveal is that their wastewater surveillance and they do genomic testing of the samples that come through in the wastewater, and they're seeing new Omicron subvariants emerging, BQ.1 and XBB, which sound like sort of online slang that I just haven't kind of kept pace with. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_651,covid_4277,"28% of eligible Australians, to be precise. And when you look at the Commonwealth data on this, that's around about 5 million Australians over the age of 16 have not had their third dose, and many of them would have had their second dose a year ago. So they have virtually no protection left against infection, and they've got declining protection against severe disease."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_652,covid_4277,"So in other words, you get a great response to the first vaccine. But with subsequent influenza vaccines, for example, you're not getting as good a response as you did originally. Immune imprinting, or some people call it original antigenic sin."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_653,covid_4277,"So first it was just Omicron, then it was Omicron 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And now we've got experts talking about this idea of a variant soup, or variant clouds where there's lots of¡­they've got a lot of similarities, but there's also distinctive differences. And no one's really quite sure which one's going to become the dominant variant going forward."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_654,covid_4277,"XBB is the other variant, and now I'll tell you where they came from. So XBB is a recombination of genes from two subvariants, they're all of the Omicron family, and the BA2 subvariants recombined to form XBB, and it's circulating in Southeast Asia and has come here as well. The BQ.1s are a subvariant of BA5."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_655,covid_4294,CUNY students and faculty are sounding the alarm about a mandatory on-campus COVID PCR testing program that they say fails to accommodate work schedules and has locked people out of their classes.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_656,covid_4294,"The program began in the summer of 2021 when the city¡¯s sprawling university system, with 25 campuses and nearly a quarter-million students, awarded a small testing company, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc., a $35 million contract, originally to provide ongoing ¡°surveillance¡± testing that included randomized testing and separate weekly testing for unvaccinated students."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_657,covid_4294,"Unlike rapid testing, which can immediately identify people with transmissible COVID, the PCR tests take 24 hours (or 48 on weekends) to process at Applied DNA¡¯s Long Island lab ¡ª leaving some students to go to class while the test results are still unknown. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_658,covid_4294,"At Brooklyn College, where CUNY community members have more hours to show up for testing, some praise the system."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_735,covid_4291,"Hotez points to the new bivalent boosters, which were formulated to target the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 are descendants of BA.5, so the vaccines probably also provide some amount of protection against them, and that knowledge would perhaps provide extra motivation to get the new shots.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_830,covid vaccine_4090,"Using a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis, the risk of herpes zoster in the month after receiving a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was no different when compared with a control period 60 to 90 days following an individuals' last dose (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.82-1.01, P=0.08), reported Nisha Acharya, MD, MS, of the University of California San Francisco, and colleagues."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_831,covid vaccine_4090,"There was no increase in risk of herpes zoster after COVID-19 vaccination when individuals were stratified by age, immunocompromised status, or type of vaccine administered, the group wrote in JAMA Network Openopens in a new tab or window."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_832,covid vaccine_4090,"And when compared with influenza vaccination during a period before the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a slightly lower shingles risk (P<0.001), while no difference between the two vaccines were seen early on in the pandemic, according to the findings."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_833,covid vaccine_4090,"Compared with previous work, our study had a larger sample, which enabled us to control for confounders that were not included in other studies, such as measures of healthcare use, history of zoster vaccination, and comorbidity-related risk factors for herpes zoster rather than weighted indices, Acharya and co-authors wrote."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_834,covid vaccine_4090,"Our study included a racially and ethnically heterogenous cohort compared with the studies conducted in Israel and may therefore better represent post-vaccination herpes zoster event risk in diverse populations, according to the researchers."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_835,covid vaccine_4091,Health chiefs are monitoring a mild but vaccine resistant strain of Covid as hospital admissions for the virus begin to rebound.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_836,covid vaccine_4091,"The BN.1 variant is now behind one in 20 infections nationwide estimates suggest, with numbers doubling roughly every two weeks."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_848,covid vaccine_4094,Rako Science and Pictor today unveiled their new antibody test ¨C dubbed Test2Detect ¨C which they say will give people critical information for their Covid-19 vaccination plans.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_849,covid vaccine_4094,"Initially to be made available at Rako¡¯s Auckland CBD and Christchurch locations, the tests are able to detect whether a person¡¯s body generates an immune response from having caught the coronavirus."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_850,covid vaccine_4094,The tests are expected to be useful for people keen to regularly check their virus antibody levels ¨C something that may help them guide when to get booster shots.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_851,covid vaccine_4094,A blood sample is collected using Rako Science and Pictor's Test2Direct - a simple antibody test that can detect whether someone has had been unknowingly infected with the virus that causes Covid-19.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_852,covid vaccine_4094,"University of Auckland immunologist Dr Anna Brooks, who serves as a consultant with Auckland-based Pictor, said the test would also be useful for those people experiencing Long Covid symptoms, but who hadn¡¯t had confirmation of infection."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_853,covid vaccine_4096,"For a study published in JAMA Oncology, Dr. Hazenberg and colleagues investigated whether a third mRNA-1273 vaccination is linked with increased neutralization of antibody concentrations in patients with hematologic cancers who are immunocompromised compared with levels obtained in healthy controls after the standard two-dose mRNA vaccination schedule."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_854,covid vaccine_4096,"¡°In most patients, we observed that three mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations led to similar antibody concentrations that were obtained in healthy individuals after two vaccinations. Surprisingly, autologous transplantation for MM did not in any way hamper antibody responses to vaccination. Additionally, patients with graft versus host disease had better responses than anticipated, and patients receiving high dose chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia mounted potent antibody responses. Thus, patients with hematologic malignancies simply need an extra vaccination.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_855,covid vaccine_4096,"When three-dose schedule antibody concentrations are reached in immunocompromised patients, they are comparable to those of healthy controls after two doses, she says, adding that vaccination should not be deferred in patients with hematologic conditions during a pandemic, or in patients receiving immunochemotherapy or transplantation."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_856,covid vaccine_4096,"¡°When B cell numbers are lower than normal, and even with very low numbers of B cells, patients can mount potent antibody responses,¡± Dr. Hazenberg says. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_857,covid vaccine_4096,"¡°In patients receiving B cell-depleting therapies, vaccination can be effective, partly because other immune cells, such as T cells, are activated.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_858,covid vaccine_4096,"Nevertheless, patients with absent antibody responses are at higher risk for COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality than healthy individuals."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_859,covid vaccine_4100,The NHS in Shropshire is urging adults with long-term health conditions to take up the offer of a free flu jab and Covid-19 booster as soon as possible to protect them this winter.

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_933,covid_4313,"The two sublineages are responsible for more than 10% of all current U.S. cases, according to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data ¡ª just one week after they weren¡¯t even significant enough to list."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_934,covid_4313,"But if they do spread rapidly, they could threaten to reverse a nationwide decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths, leading Fauci to urge Americans against letting their guard down."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_935,covid_4313,"Fauci said the strains have a concerning ¡°doubling time,¡± referring to how quickly they spread."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_936,covid_4313,"The U.K. Health Security Agency reported earlier this month that the strains even demonstrate a growth advantage over BA.5, which was considered the most contagious Covid strain to date."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_969,covid_4319,"As the US moves into the fall, Covid-19 cases are dropping. Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters. But virus experts fear that the downward trend may soon reverse itself, thanks to this gaggle of new variants."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_970,covid_4319,"Lumped together, the variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new Covid-19 infections nationwide last week, according to the latest estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1027,covid_4332,"Medically significant illness, death, and health care system strain can be reduced through vaccination and therapeutics to prevent severe illness, complemented by use of multiple prevention methods to reduce exposure risk and an emphasis on protecting persons at high risk for severe illness."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1028,covid_4332,"As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post¨CCOVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death (1)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1029,covid_4332,"These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity (2)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1030,covid_4332,"Exposure risk can be mitigated through nonpharmaceutical interventions, including improving ventilation, use of masks or respirators indoors, and testing (4). The risk for medically significant illness increases with age, disability status, and underlying medical conditions but is considerably reduced by immunity derived from vaccination, previous infection, or both, as well as timely access to effective biomedical prevention measures and treatments (3,5)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1031,covid_4332,COVID-19 vaccines are highly protective against severe illness and death and provide a lesser degree of protection against asymptomatic and mild infection (6).

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1057,covid_4339,"Following today¡¯s meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices¡¯ (ACIP), CDC is expanding eligibility of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to everyone 5 years of age and older."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1058,covid_4339,CDC now recommends that children ages 5 through 11 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their initial Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination series.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1059,covid_4339,"As cases increase across the country, a booster dose will safely help restore and enhance protection against severe disease."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1060,covid_4339,"In addition, today CDC is strengthening its recommendation that those 12 and older who are immunocompromised and those 50 and older should receive a second booster dose at least 4 months after their first. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1061,covid_4339,"Whether it is your first booster, or your second, if you haven¡¯t had a vaccine dose since the beginning of December 2021 and you are eligible, now is the time to get one."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1062,covid_4339,"With cases increasing, it is important that all people have the protection they need, which is why, today, CDC has also strengthened another booster recommendation. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1063,covid_4340,"Today, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., endorsed the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices¡¯ (ACIP) recommendation that all children 6 months through 5 years of age should receive a COVID-19 vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1064,covid_4340,This expands eligibility for vaccination to nearly 20 million additional children and means that all Americans ages 6 months and older are now eligible for vaccination. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1065,covid_4340,Parents and caregivers can now get their children 6 months through 5 years of age vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to better protect them from COVID-19.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1066,covid_4340,"All children, including children who have already had COVID-19, should get vaccinated."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1067,covid_4340, Children in this younger age group can be vaccinated with whichever vaccine is available (either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech).
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1068,covid_4340,"I encourage parents and caregivers with questions to talk to their doctor, nurse, or local pharmacist to learn more about the benefits of vaccinations and the importance of protecting their children by getting them vaccinated."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1069,covid_4342,"Compared with patients aged 0¨C17 years without previous COVID-19, those with previous COVID-19 had higher rates of acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1070,covid_4342,"The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevated adjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with those without). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1071,covid_4342,"Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in this study population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs and symptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurological conditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleeping disorders."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1072,covid_4342,"Among children aged 2¨C4 years, the highest aHRs for patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 were for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (aHR  = 2.39), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.52), and coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (1.47) (Table 3). Unlike other age groups, children aged 2¨C4 years had higher rates of asthma diagnosis (1.12) and respiratory signs and symptoms (1.07) after COVID-19."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1073,covid_4342,"Among children aged 5¨C11 years, the highest aHRs for patients with COVID-19 compared with those without were for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (2.84), venous thromboembolic event (2.69), and acute and unspecified renal failure (1.38)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1074,covid_4342,"Among patients aged 12¨C17 years, the highest aHRs for those with COVID-19 compared with those without were for acute pulmonary embolism (2.03), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.66), and venous thromboembolic event (1.52)."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1075,covid_4343,"The world has never been in a better position to end the Covid-19 pandemic, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1076,covid_4343,"¡°Last week, the number of weekly reported deaths from Covid-19 was the lowest since March 2020,¡± he said. ¡°We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic. We¡¯re not there yet, but the end is in sight."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1077,covid_4343,"There is still a risk of more variants, deaths, disruption and uncertainty, he said, ¡°so let¡¯s seize this opportunity.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1078,covid_4343,"They are ¡°an urgent call for governments to take a hard look at their policies and strengthen them for Covid-19 and future pathogens with pandemic potential,¡± Tedros said."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1079,covid_4343,"Although official case counts have become significantly underreported, trends have shown a steady drop in cases both globally and in the US."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1080,covid_4343,"According to latest WHO update, weekly case counts are falling in all regions, with an overall fall of 28% compared to a week before. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1081,covid_4345,"Today, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., signed a decision memo that Novavax¡¯s COVID-19 vaccine be used as another primary series option for adolescents ages 12 through 17."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1082,covid_4345,This recommendation follows FDA¡¯s authorization to authorize the vaccine for this age group under emergency use. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1083,covid_4345,"Novavax¡¯s COVID-19 vaccine, which is available now, is an important tool in the pandemic and provides a more familiar type of COVID-19 vaccine technology for adolescents. Having multiple types of vaccines offers more options and flexibility for the public, jurisdictions, and vaccine providers."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1084,covid_4345,Novavax¡¯s COVID-19 vaccine packages harmless proteins of the COVID-19 virus alongside another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to the virus in the future. 
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1085,covid_4345,"Vaccines¡ªlike the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine¡ªthat use protein subunit technology have been used for more than 30 years in the United States, beginning with the first licensed hepatitis B vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1086,covid_4345,Other protein subunit vaccines used in the United States today include those to protect against influenza and whooping cough (acellular pertussis).

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1093,covid_4347,"Dr. Anthony Fauci has a sober warning for Americans: Don¡¯t be surprised if a new, more dangerous Covid variant emerges this upcoming winter."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1094,covid_4347,"¡°We should anticipate that we very well may get another variant that would emerge, that would elude the immune response that we¡¯ve gotten from infection and/or from vaccination,¡± Fauci said at an event with the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism this week."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1095,covid_4347,But Fauci urged Americans not to let their guard down because there¡¯s always a ¡°risk of uptick¡± in the winter months.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1096,covid_4347,"¡°It looks like we¡¯re going in the right direction,¡± he said, adding: ¡°However, I think it would be a bit cavalier to all of a sudden say, ¡®We¡¯re completely through with [the pandemic].¡¯¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1097,covid_4347,"Fauci pointed to the summer of 2021, when the U.S. saw similarly low pandemic trends, only for the omicron variant to emerge and cause a record-breaking surge in cases last winter."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1098,covid_4347,"Emerging research suggests that some new subvariants, including one called BA.4.6, appear to evade immunity even more effectively than BA.5 ¡ª though it¡¯s unclear whether any of them will overtake BA.5 as the country¡¯s dominant Covid strain."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1099,covid_4348,"The federal government is ending its free at-home Covid-19 test program this week, citing a lack of funding and efforts to preserve supply ahead of an anticipated fall surge in cases, a White House official told CNN on Sunday."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1100,covid_4348,"¡°Ordering through this program will be suspended on Friday, September 2 because Congress hasn¡¯t provided additional funding to replenish the nation¡¯s stockpile of tests,¡± the Covid.gov website reads."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1101,covid_4348,"However, officials have warned for months that, absent additional funding from Congress, the administration would be forced to roll back its Covid-19 response efforts."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1102,covid_4348,"¡°We have warned that Congressional inaction would force unacceptable tradeoffs and harm our overall COVID-19 preparedness and response¡ªand that the consequences would likely worsen over time,¡± the White House official told CNN."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1103,covid_4348,"¡°Unfortunately, because of the limited funding we have to work with, we have had to make impossible choices about which tools and programs to invest in¡ªand which ones we must downsize, pause, or end all together.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1104,covid_4348,"Still, the official said the administration would ¡°expeditiously resume distribution of free tests through COVIDTests.gov¡± if and when Congress allocates additional funding, but ¡°[u]ntil then, we believe reserving the remaining tests for distribution later this year is the best course.¡±"
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1105,covid_4349,President Joe Biden said Thursday that he¡¯s tested positive for Covid-19 but will continue to work while in isolation at the White House despite his mild symptoms.
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1106,covid_4349,"In a video posted to Twitter, Biden told Americans that he is ¡°doing well¡± and that his symptoms continue to be mild."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1107,covid_4349,"¡°I guess you heard, this morning I tested positive for Covid. But I¡¯ve been double vaccinated, double boosted.

It¡¯s gonna be OK,¡± Biden, who was unmasked while standing outside on the Truman Balcony, said in the 20-second video the White House says was filmed by a masked and socially distanced videographer."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1108,covid_4349,"The mild symptoms and diagnosis protocol for Biden ¨C a double-boosted 79-year-old at high risk for experiencing severe illness ¨C will mean isolating and ¡°working and resting¡± at the White House residence for the rest of the day, according to a senior administration official."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1109,covid_4349,"This is the first time Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, and he last tested negative on Tuesday, per White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1110,covid_4349,"Biden tested positive for Covid-19 Thursday morning and has begun taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1111,covid_4352,"China has become the first country to green-light an inhaled Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for potential use of the needle-free product in the country, where suppressing the spread of Covid-19 remains a top priority."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1112,covid_4352,"The vaccine maker, CanSino Biologics, said in a statement Sunday that China¡¯s medicines regulator had approved the inhaled dose for emergency use as a booster vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1113,covid_4352,"The product, known as Convidecia Air, delivers a vaccine dose through a puff of air from a nebulizer that is then inhaled by mouth. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1114,covid_4352,"According to a database maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), CanSino¡¯s new product is one of two specifically ¡°inhaled¡± vaccines that had reached clinical phase development, as a number of companies worldwide research innovative ways to deliver Covid-19 protection via the nose and mouth."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1115,covid_4352,"CanSino cautioned in a company filing that some steps, including conducting clinical trials, and administrative approval remain before the vaccine can go to market. "

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1126,covid_4354,"Today, we have expanded the options available to adults in the U.S. by recommending another safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1127,covid_4354," If you have been waiting for a COVID-19 vaccine built on a different technology than those previously available, now is the time to join the millions of Americans who have been vaccinated. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1128,covid_4354,"With COVID-19 cases on the rise again across parts of the country, vaccination is critical to help protect against the complications of severe COVID-19 disease."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1129,covid_4357,"At least 7.6 million people have received an updated Covid booster since the start of September, according to data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number represents around 3.6% of people currently eligible to receive the shots in the U.S."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1130,covid_4357,"The data does not include people who received updated Pfizer-BioNTech boosters in Idaho and Texas, the CDC said, so it is likely an underestimate."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1131,covid_4357,"Dr. Scott Roberts, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist, said the relatively low booster uptake was ""demoralizing."" "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1132,covid_4357,"I would expect a much higher proportion of Americans to have gotten the booster by this point, he said."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1133,covid_4357,"Nearly 80% of the U.S. population has received at least one shot of a primary Covid vaccine, and nearly 68% is considered fully vaccinated by the CDC, meaning they've gotten either one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two shots of Pfizer's, Moderna's or Novavax's, which was authorized in July."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1134,covid_4357,"Still, the U.S. has seen an uptick in demand for Covid shots since the booster rollout began: The U.S. is currently administering around 356,000 Covid vaccine doses per day, as a weekly average."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1135,covid_4360,"The Chinese metropolis of Chengdu imposed a sweeping city-wide lockdown on Thursday evening, confining 21 million residents to their homes as the country doubles down on its zero-Covid policy ahead of a key Communist Party meeting."

Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1143,covid_4361,"The comments caught some in the administration by surprise, according to two officials."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1144,covid_4361,"A day later, an administration official told CNN that the President¡¯s comments do not mark a change in policy toward the administration¡¯s handling of the virus, and there are no plans to lift the Public Health Emergency, which has been in place since January 2020 and is currently extended through October 13."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1145,covid_4361,"Officials, including the President, have previously spoken about a new phase for the virus but have specifically said it is not yet over."

Congressional negotiators have indicated that Covid-19 funding is unlikely to be included in the funding bill."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1147,covid_4362,"Following FDA¡¯s regulatory action today, CDC is updating its recommendations to allow certain immunocompromised individuals and people over the age of 50 who received an initial booster dose at least 4 months ago to be eligible for another mRNA booster to increase their protection against severe disease from COVID-19."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1148,covid_4362,"Separately and in addition, based on newly published data, adults who received a primary vaccine and booster dose of Johnson & Johnson¡¯s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 4 months ago may now receive a second booster dose using an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1149,covid_4362,"These updated recommendations acknowledge the increased risk of severe disease in certain populations including those who are elderly or over the age of 50 with multiple underlying conditions, along with the currently available data on vaccine and booster effectiveness."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1150,covid_4362,"Today, CDC expanded eligibility for an additional booster dose for certain individuals who may be at higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19."
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1151,covid_4362,"Boosters are safe, and people over the age of 50 can now get an additional booster 4 months after their prior dose to increase their protection further. "
Evidence_Covid_C2.2_1152,covid_4362,"CDC continues to recommend that all eligible adults, adolescents, and children 5 and older be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, which includes getting an initial booster when eligible."
